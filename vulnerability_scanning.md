# Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is a key security practice that identifies security weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications before attackers can exploit them.

## What is Vulnerability Scanning?

Vulnerability scanning is the automated process of proactively identifying security flaws, misconfigurations, outdated software, and missing patches within your IT environment. It helps organizations understand their security posture and prioritize remediation efforts.

## Types of Vulnerability Scans

- **Network Scanning:** Identifies open ports, services, and vulnerabilities on network devices and servers.  
- **Host-Based Scanning:** Analyzes individual hosts for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, often requiring an agent.  
- **Application Scanning:** Examines web applications or software for coding errors, security misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities like SQL injection.  
- **Credentialed vs. Non-Credentialed Scans:** Credentialed scans log in to systems for deeper analysis; non-credentialed scans check externally.

## How Vulnerability Scanning Works

1. **Discovery:** Identify all devices and systems to scan.  
2. **Scanning:** Use tools to probe systems for known vulnerabilities based on databases and signatures.  
3. **Analysis:** Aggregate scan results to identify real risks and false positives.  
4. **Reporting:** Generate reports detailing vulnerabilities, severity, and remediation steps.  
5. **Remediation:** Prioritize and fix vulnerabilities based on risk.  
6. **Rescanning:** Confirm that fixes are effective.

## Best Practices

- Schedule regular scans (weekly, monthly) and after major changes.  
- Use credentialed scans when possible for deeper visibility.  
- Keep scanning tools and vulnerability databases updated.  
- Prioritize fixing critical and high-risk vulnerabilities first.  
- Integrate scanning results into your broader security program and patch management.  
- Document and track remediation efforts.

## Sample Basic Scan Command with OpenVAS

```bash
# Start OpenVAS scanner and manager, then run a scan targeting 192.168.1.0/24
openvas-start
omp --create-target --name "Local Network" --hosts "192.168.1.0/24"
omp --start-task <task_id>
