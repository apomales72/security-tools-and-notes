# Incident Response Checklist

A step-by-step guide to effectively handle cybersecurity incidents.

---

## 1. Preparation
- [ ] Establish and train an incident response team  
- [ ] Define roles and responsibilities  
- [ ] Develop and maintain incident response policies and procedures  
- [ ] Ensure necessary tools and resources are available (forensics tools, communication channels, backups)  
- [ ] Conduct regular security awareness training  

---

## 2. Identification
- [ ] Detect and report potential incidents (alerts, logs, user reports)  
- [ ] Collect and analyze initial data  
- [ ] Verify if an incident occurred  
- [ ] Classify the incident type and severity  

---

## 3. Containment
- [ ] Short-term containment to limit impact  
- [ ] Isolate affected systems or networks  
- [ ] Preserve evidence and logs  
- [ ] Implement temporary fixes or workarounds  

---

## 4. Eradication
- [ ] Identify and remove the root cause of the incident  
- [ ] Scan and clean infected systems  
- [ ] Apply patches or updates as needed  
- [ ] Reset credentials or access controls if compromised  

---

## 5. Recovery
- [ ] Restore systems from clean backups  
- [ ] Monitor systems for any signs of persistent threat  
- [ ] Gradually bring systems back online  
- [ ] Confirm that systems are functioning normally  

---

## 6. Lessons Learned
- [ ] Conduct a post-incident review meeting  
- [ ] Document findings and timeline  
- [ ] Identify gaps and areas for improvement  
- [ ] Update incident response plan accordingly  
- [ ] Share relevant information with stakeholders

## 7. Tools Recommendation

- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**  
  Examples: Splunk, Elastic Security, IBM QRadar, Microsoft Sentinel  
  *Use for centralized log collection, correlation, and alerting.*

- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**  
  Examples: CrowdStrike Falcon, Carbon Black, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint  
  *Monitor and investigate endpoint activities.*

- **Network Traffic Analysis Tools**  
  Examples: Wireshark, Zeek (Bro), NetFlow analyzers  
  *Analyze network packets and traffic patterns.*

- **Forensics Tools**  
  Examples: Autopsy, FTK Imager, Volatility  
  *Used for disk, memory analysis, and evidence collection.*

- **Vulnerability Scanners**  
  Examples: Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys  
  *Identify known vulnerabilities on systems.*

- **Incident Management Platforms**  
  Examples: TheHive, ServiceNow Security Operations  
  *Track incidents and coordinate response efforts.*

- **Communication Tools**  
  Examples: Slack, Microsoft Teams (with secure channels), PagerDuty  
  *Facilitate timely and secure communication within the team.*
